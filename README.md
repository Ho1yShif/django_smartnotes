# django_smartnotes
Welcome to the smartnotes app that I built in order to familiarize myself with Django as per the [Django Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/django-essential-training/what-is-django?u=39207972) course by Leticia Portella <br>
Clone the repo, `cd` to the project directory, and run the command `python manage.py runserver` to check it out!
